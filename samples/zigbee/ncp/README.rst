The :ref:`Zigbee <ug_zigbee>` NCP sample demonstrates the usage of Zigbee's :ref:`ug_zigbee_platform_design_ncp_details` architecture.

Together with the source code from `NCP Host for Zigbee`_, you can use this sample to create a complete and functional Zigbee device.
For example, as shown in the `Testing`_ scenario, you can program a development kit with the NCP sample and bundle it with the light control application on the NCP host processor.

You can then use this sample together with the :ref:`Zigbee network coordinator <zigbee_network_coordinator_sample>` and the :ref:`Zigbee light bulb <zigbee_light_bulb_sample>` to set up a basic Zigbee network.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf52840dk_nrf52840, nrf52840dongle_nrf52840, nrf52833dk_nrf52833, nrf21540dk_nrf52840

You can use any of the development kits listed above.

For this sample to work, you also need the following:

* `NCP Host for Zigbee`_ tool, which is based on the ZBOSS stack and available for download as a standalone :file:`zip` package as one of :ref:`ug_zigbee_tools`.
  It contains the source code for all parts of the ZBOSS library for the NCP host.
  This allows you to recompile the library for the designated hardware platform.
  Running the NCP Host for Zigbee requires a PC with an operating system compatible with the 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 Linux.
* The :ref:`Zigbee network coordinator <zigbee_network_coordinator_sample>` sample on one separate device.
* The :ref:`zigbee_light_bulb_sample` sample on one separate device.

This means that you need at least three development kits for testing this sample.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates using a Nordic Semiconductor's Development Kit as Zigbee Network Co-Processor.

The sample uses the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LIBRARY_NCP_DEV` Kconfig option, which is available in the :ref:`development version of the ZBOSS stack libraries <nrfxlib:zboss_configuration>` (managed by the :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_LIBRARY_DEVELOPMENT` Kconfig option, also enabled by default).
The NCP Kconfig option extends the compilation process with an implementation of the ZBOSS API serialization through NCP commands.
It also implements the ZBOSS default signal handler function, which controls the ZBOSS and commissioning logic.

The NCP application creates and starts a ZBOSS thread as well as the communication channel for NCP commands that are exchanged between the connectivity device and the host processor.

Configuration
*************

|config|

The IEEE address of the device is configured in the same way as for other Zigbee samples.

Serial communication setup
==========================

The communication channel uses Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:uart_api` API.
This serial device is selected with :option:`CONFIG_ZIGBEE_UART_DEVICE_NAME`.

By default, the NCP sample communicates through the UART serialization (``UART0``).
As a result, Zephyr's logger is configured to use ``UART1``, which is available through GPIO pins (``P1.00`` and ``P1.01``).

The ``UART0`` pins are configured by Devicetree :file:`overlay` files for each supported development kit in the :file:`boards` directory.

Optional communication through USB
----------------------------------

You can change the communication channel from the default UART to nRF USB by using the :file:`usb.overlay` configuration file.

The USB device VID and PID are configured by the sample's Kconfig file.

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Download and extract the `NCP Host for Zigbee`_ package.

   .. note::
      If you are using an Linux distribution different than the 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04, make sure to rebuild the package libraries and applications by following the instructions described in the :file:`README.rst`  file in the NCP Host for Zigbee package.

#. If you are using `Optional communication through USB`_, connect the nRF USB port of the NCP sample's development kit to the PC USB port with an USB cable.
#. Get the kitâ€™s serial port name (for example, /dev/ttyACM0).
   If you are communicating through the nRF USB, get the nRF USB serial port name.
#. Turn on the development kit that runs the network coordinator sample.
   When **LED 3** turns on, this development kit has become the Coordinator of the Zigbee network.
#. Turn on the development kit that runs the light bulb sample.
   When **LED 3** turns on, the light bulb has become a Router inside the network.

   .. tip::
        If **LED 3** does not turn on, press **Button 1** on the Coordinator to reopen the network.

#. Start the light control application by running the following command with *serial_port_name* replaced with the serial port name used for communication with the NCP sample:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      NCP_SLAVE_PTY=*serial_port_name* ./application/light_sample/light_control/light_control

The light control device joins the Zigbee network, searches for a light bulb to control, and starts sending On/Off commands with a 15-sec period that toggle the **LED 4** on the light bulb on and off.

Dependencies
************

This sample uses the following |NCS| libraries:

* Zigbee subsystem:

  * :file:`zb_nrf_platform.h`

This sample uses the following `sdk-nrfxlib`_ libraries:

* :ref:`nrfxlib:zboss` (development version)

In addition, it uses the following Zephyr libraries:

* :file:`include/device.h`
* :ref:`zephyr:usb_api`
* :ref:`zephyr:logging_api`
* :ref:`zephyr:uart_api`
